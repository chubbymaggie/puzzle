{"name":"Puzzle","tagline":"Tool Support for Language Product Lines Engineering","body":"### Language Product Lines Engineering in a Nutshell\r\nTo improve cost-benefit when using DSLs, the research community in soft- ware languages engineering has proposed mechanisms to increase reuse during the construction of DSLs. The idea is to leverage previous engineering efforts and minimize implementation from scratch [15]. These reuse mechanisms are based on the premise that **“software languages are software too”** [7] so it is possible to use software engineering techniques to facilitate their construction [9]. In par- ticular, there are approaches that take ideas from Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) [2] and Software Product Lines Engineering (SPLE) [16] during the construction of new DSLs.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/damende/puzzle/blob/master/website-sources/lple.jpg?raw=true\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 10px;\"/>\r\n\r\n### Puzzle in action\r\nPuzzle is a set of tools intended to support Language Product Lines Engineering. More concretely, Puzzle provides: (1) analysis mechanisms for analyzing potential reuse in sets of domain-specific languages; (2) reverse-engineering strategies for synthesizing language product lines from sets of domain-specific languages. \r\n\r\nYou can now download the Puzzle's source code as well as a set of examples and tool demos. All the required information is provided below:\r\n\r\n**Tool demonstrations**\r\n\r\nLet us illustrate the capabilities of Puzzle by means of some short videos.\r\n\r\n**Downloading and configuration**\r\n* For the **impatient**, we have prepared a virtual machine image that includes all the tooling and configuration needed to use Puzzle. Just download it, open the pre-installed Eclipse IDE, and try the examples. You need [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).\r\n* For **those who have some more time**, we have prepared a tutorial to download and configure Puzzle from scratch. \r\n\r\n**Examples**\r\n\r\n* A heterogeneous example: State Machines, Logo, and Flowcharts.\r\n* A family of DSLs for State Machines: UML state diagrams, Rhapsody, and Harel's statecharts.\r\n* Empirical study: Evaluating potential reuse in the wild.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* [David Méndez Acuña](http://damenac.snack.ws/)\r\n* [José A.
