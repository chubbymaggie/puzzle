{"name":"Puzzle","tagline":"Tool Support for Language Product Lines Engineering","body":"## Language Product Lines Engineering in a Nutshell.\r\nTo improve cost-benefit when using DSLs, the research community in soft- ware languages engineering has proposed mechanisms to increase reuse during the construction of DSLs. The idea is to leverage previous engineering efforts and minimize implementation from scratch [15]. These reuse mechanisms are based on the premise that **“software languages are software too”** [7] so it is possible to use software engineering techniques to facilitate their construction [9]. In par- ticular, there are approaches that take ideas from Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) [2] and Software Product Lines Engineering (SPLE) [16] during the construction of new DSLs.\r\n\r\n## Puzzle\r\nPuzzle is a set of tools intended to support Language Product Lines Engineering. More concretely, Puzzle provides: (1) analysis mechanisms for analyzing potential reuse in sets of domain-specific languages; (2) reverse-engineering strategies for synthesizing language product lines from sets of domain-specific languages. \r\n\r\n## Downloading and usage\r\nYou can now download the Puzzle's source code as well as a set of examples and tool demos.
