\section{Tool demonstration}
\label{sec:tooldemo}

The approach presented in this paper is tool-supported. That means that we implemented a the tooling needed to support the ideas and concepts. The tooling is implemented on top of Eclipse IDE and, in particular, the Eclipse Modeling Framework. In the following, we present two different videos. The first one illustrates the use of our tool in the illustrating example presented in section \ref{sec:motivation}. The second video shows the tool for the case study of the state machines presented in section \ref{sec:validation}.

\item \textbf{Tool demonstration 2:} UML state diagrams, Rhapsody, and Harel state charts. URL: video
