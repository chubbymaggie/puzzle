\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:validation}

In this section we evaluate our approach by using two different evaluation scenarios. The former corresponds to a case study of a set of DSLs for expressing state machines. The idea is to test our approach in a set of language where we know that there are commonalities that we know in advance. The second case study aims to test our approach in a more realistic scenario. We take some DSLs from GitHub public repositories.
