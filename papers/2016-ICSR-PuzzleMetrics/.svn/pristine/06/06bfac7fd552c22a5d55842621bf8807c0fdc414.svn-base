\section{Expected contributions}
\label{sec:expectedcontributions}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{State of the art:} The first big contribution of this research will be a deep study of the state of the art we are currently conducting. This state of the art will be based on the analysis of the challenges that should be overcome during the implementation of a family of DSLs. We discussed some of them previously in section 1.

\item \textbf{A novel approach for languages modularization:} The approach for languages modularization we are proposing introduces pertinent advantages to the community basically because it increases the spectrum of the reusability that can be achieved with the idea of families of DSLs.

\item \textbf{The notion of languages interface:} As mentioned before, the principle of susbtitutability becomes really important for supporting multi-dimensional variability existing in families of DSLs. The notion of languages interfaces for each of the variability realization techniques will be the second contribution of this research.

\item \textbf{An approach for multi-dimensional variability modeling:} One of the main challenges during the implementation of a family of DSLs is the modeling of the multi-dimensional variability. We plan to provide an approach that addresses this issue.
