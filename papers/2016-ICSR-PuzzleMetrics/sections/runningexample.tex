\section{Motivating scenario}
\label{sec:example}

In this section we present an example that we use to illustrate the basic concepts introduced in the previous section and that we will use to present \textsc{PuzzleMetrics}. Fig. \ref{fig:motivating-example}.

Our motivation scenario is composed of three languages: logo program, state charts, and flowchart. As shown in the figure, each language is in an indepentendent package because it was implemented in isolation.
