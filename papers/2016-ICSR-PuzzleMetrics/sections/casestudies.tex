\section{Case studies}
\label{sec:casestudies}

In this section we present an inventory of families in which we have applied the analysis introduced in this paper. The idea is to show how our tool behaves while analyzing different types of families. Because of space limitation, we just show an extract of the results resumed in some data that we then analyze. However, the description of each family is accompanied with a URL where the reader will find the complete result provided by the tool. 

\subsection{Simple, Timed, and Hierarchical State Machines}

\subsection{Rhapsody + Harel's Statecharts + UML}

An important of this family with respect to the other two is that whereas in the two .. cases the families were built by us by respecting some knowledge of the... this other goes from a different team. The code of this family already exists. This allow us to see the behavior of our tool in a real-life example thus reducing the possible slant that may exist during the construction of the example.
