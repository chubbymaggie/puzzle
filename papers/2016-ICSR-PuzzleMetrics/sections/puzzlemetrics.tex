\section{Downloading and using \textsc{PuzzleMetrics}}
\label{sec:puzzlemetrics}

PuzzleMetrics can be downloaded from the following URL\footnote{We try to keep the downloading site as anonymous as possible in order to respect the submission double-blinded rule of this conference. This will be modified by adding the corresponding credits to the authors if the paper is accepted for publication.}. The download corresponds to a virtual machine where there is an Eclipse distribution that already contains all the dependencies. Besides, the image contains a workspace that contains all the families used in this paper. That is, the motivating example presented in section X and the case studies presented in section Y.
