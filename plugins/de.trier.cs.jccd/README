================================================================================

  What is it?
  -----------

    The Java Code Clone Detection API (JCCD) allows to implement individual code
    clone detectors. These code clone detectors can be easily integrated into 
    other Java applications.

    JCCD is based on a pipeline architecture which allows to replace whole parts
    of the detection process without changing the overall pipeline. This enables
    to re-implement state-of-the-art techniques as well as to realize new ideas
    and concepts.


  System Requirements
  -------------------

    JDK 1.5 or above.


  Using JCCD
  ----------

    - copy `jccd-*.jar` together with all jar files from `lib` into the class-
      path of your application.
    - put the file `src/log4j.properties` in the root of your application.


  Licensing
  ---------

    See the file called `LICENSE`.
